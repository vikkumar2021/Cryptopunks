Files being submitted:
1)ManualLearner.py

- ManualLearner.py implements the manual logical strategy used for trading within sampled data. It's main function runs the in-sample testing of JPM and creates the chart presented in the report.  

2)StrategyLearner.py

- ManualLearner.py implements QLearner as the reinfcement learning algorith used to create a trading policy. It's main function runs the in-sample testing of JPM and creates the chart presented in the report. It's add_evidence function populated the Qtable with historical data, training the learner to build a policy that will be later on used with the TestPolicy function. The testPolicy function queries the QLearner and find the most optimal way to make money in this case!

3)experiment1.py

- Experiment 1 contains the code to compare the ManualLearner and the Strategy Learner. Its main code compiled the information into a chart and saves if into the working directory.

4)experiment2.py

- Experiment 2 assesses the effect of a increasing impact coefficient. The data used for this evaluation is compiled in the main function of this script. 

5)indicators.py

- Indicators.py contains all the indicators being used and imported in ManualLearner and StrategyLearner. It contains the code for Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Price to SMA ratio, MACD and momentum

6)QLearner.py

- Qlearner is the reinforment learning script used by the StrategyLearner.py script.

7)testproject.py

- testproject.py runs all of the files above by running the main functions of the 4 main codes(ManualLearner, Strategy Learner, experiment1 and experiment2). Only this file needs to be run.
